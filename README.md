# Fault Detection System for Hydraulic Rig

## Overview
This project is designed to monitor and indentify faults in a the chemical processes of a hydraulic rig. The parameters observed are: temperature, pressure, flow rate, and pH. To facilitate this, the "Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used. Machine learning models like Scikit-learn and RandomForestClassifier are employed to diagnose the type and severity of faults providing early warnings. Also included is a web-based interface for easy interaction and visualization.
